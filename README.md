# Case
Here are some cases for learning.  
Each case can be run independently.
## LSTM_CRF_pytorch_demo
This demo shows a basic LSTM+CRF structure that is based on the code provided by pytorch tutorial file.
## LSTM_CRF_pytorch_for_CET
This demo is a varant of LSTM_CRF_pytorch_demo in which the task it's facing is no longer NER but CET(College English Test).
## difflib
This demo uses the python package difflib to deal with the data.
## cnn-minst
This demo uses a CNN to train the minst dataset, and the model can predict a number written by human.
