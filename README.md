# Case
Here are some cases for learning.  
Each case can be run independently.
## Estimator_example
This demo shows the basic usage of Estinater frame of tensorflow which is important for us to understand high-level encapsulated framework.
## LSTM_CRF_pytorch_demo
This demo shows a basic LSTM+CRF structure that is based on the code provided by pytorch tutorial file.
## LSTM_CRF_pytorch_for_CET
This demo is a varant of LSTM_CRF_pytorch_demo in which the task it's facing is no longer NER but CET(College English Test).
## pyplot
This file includes several cripts about how to draw pictures by matplotlib.
